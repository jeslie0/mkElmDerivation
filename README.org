* Progress
Currently, we can parse the downloaded elm package json, and get the hashes for the packages. The outputted file has correct hashes in it, however failures to download the package aren't handled well.

- [ ] Use the Writer Monad to keep track of hashing failures.
- [X] Use Reader Monad to store Handle state.
- [ ] Need to add in a comparison test.
  - If we run this several times, we don't want to pull down already hashed packages.
- [ ] Fetch JSON remotely (GET).
